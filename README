This is an attempt to convert an existing Java app to
single page Javascript.


Todo
----

 - Perform calculations based on input of onblur
 - Implement validation
 - Use pdf.js instead of jspdf.js [tip!]
 - Add images and layout to PDF
 - Use Backbone controller and routes [pushState!]
 - Perhaps mimic original one-page interface instead of steps?
 - Save state using localStorage?
 - Add HTML5 geolocation to PDF output (approx. location) if
   a connection can be made
