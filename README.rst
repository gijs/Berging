Berging
=======
This is an attempt to convert an existing Java app to single page Javascript.

Preview: http://gijs.github.com/Berging/



Todo
----

 * Perform calculations based on input of onblur
 * Implement validation
 * Use pdf.js instead of jspdf.js [tip!]
 * Add images and layout to PDF
 * Use Backbone controller and routes [pushState!]
 * Perhaps mimic original one-page interface instead of steps?
 * Save state using localStorage?
 * Add HTML5 geolocation to PDF output (approx. location) if a connection can be made. Even include a staticmap of the area?
 * Make forms and layout more iOS friendly (use modernizr.js, less.js etc, use slider input instead of numbers etc.)
